# CSCI331-Group-Project
//We will be working on one file, however, we need to follow certain rules when uploading.
//Only upload working, bug-free code unless it is specifically to collaborate with others.

//When you're ready to begin coding, download the latest project file (more on that in a minute) and begin editing.
//Once you've finished coding, reupload it as the latest version using this schema:
//Call the file "Main_Program_v1_xx.cpp"
//"xx" is replaced with the latest number, for example, if you downloaded "Main_Program_v1_08.cpp", you would upload "Main_Program_v1_09.cpp"

//A few more rules of etiquette:
//Use lots of comments and be as descriptive as possible of your code!

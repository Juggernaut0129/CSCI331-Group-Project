# CSCI331-Group-Project
//We will be working on one file, however, we need to follow certain rules when uploading.

//Only upload working, bug-free code unless it is specifically to collaborate with others.

//When you're ready to begin coding, download the latest project file (more on that in a minute) and begin editing.

//Once you've finished coding, reupload it as the latest version using this schema:

//Call the file "Main_Program_v1_xx.cpp"

//"xx" is replaced with the latest number, for example, if you downloaded "Main_Program_v1_08.cpp", you would upload "Main_Program_v1_09.cpp"

//A few more rules of etiquette:

//Use lots of comments and be as descriptive as possible of your code! Other users need to be able to see and understand it easily.

//Don't edit anything other than the code you are currently working on! Anything uploaded is considered final and should only be changed with permission. If you're having problems with someone else's code, let them know what changes need to be made!

//Denote your sections of code with a simple comment at the beginning with your name. I'd like to keep track who is contributing, and how much.
